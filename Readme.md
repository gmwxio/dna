# DNA (Deterministic Name Algebra)

Like human DNA a DNA repository contains the specification for an organism.
In this case the organism is a company, department or some consistent grouping of projects and not an organic organism.
Also like organic DNA this contains zero implementation, it is pure specificaton.

The implementations are committed to other repositories.
The interaction of DNA with implementation is via code generation.
There are many syntactic forms of DNA, including 
    [Google's Protocol Buffers (protocbuf)](https://),
    [Tim Docker's Algebraic Data Language (ADL)](https://github.com/timbod7/adl),
    [Capability and Protocol Language (capnproto)](http://capnproto.org) and
    [Fuchia Interface Defintion Language (fidl)](http://).
All share the same basic properties, a simple type system
